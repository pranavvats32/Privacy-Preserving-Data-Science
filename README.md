# Privacy-Preserving Process Mining

## Overview
This project focuses on anonymizing sensitive event logs (e.g., healthcare data) while preserving essential process patterns. By applying privacy techniques such as differential privacy and k-anonymity, the goal is to protect confidential information while maintaining the utility of process mining insights.

## Features
- **Anonymization Methods:** Implements differential privacy and k-anonymity for event log sanitization.
- **Utility Measurement:** Evaluates the impact of anonymization on process patterns.
- **Process Mining Compatibility:** Ensures anonymized logs remain usable for process mining analysis.

## Deliverables
- **Code** for event log anonymization.
- **Utility measurement** to assess data retention quality.
