# Privacy-Preserving Process Mining

## Overview
This project focuses on anonymizing sensitive event logs (e.g., healthcare data) while preserving essential process patterns. By applying privacy techniques such as differential privacy and k-anonymity, the goal is to protect confidential information while maintaining the utility of process mining insights.

## Features
- **Anonymization Methods:** Implements differential privacy and k-anonymity for event log sanitization.
- **Utility Measurement:** Evaluates the impact of anonymization on process patterns.
- **Process Mining Compatibility:** Ensures anonymized logs remain usable for process mining analysis.

## Datasets
[BPI Challenge 2017](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/BPI_Challenge_2017/12696884)
(Hospital Billing)
Description: Logs related to hospital billing, including invoices, payments, and financial transactions.
It involves patient financial data that must be anonymized while retaining process patterns.

MIMIC 3 Dataset
Description: A massive dataset with ICU patient records, including lab results, medications, and diagnoses.
It provides rich event logs but requires de-identification due to its detailed patient data.
(Yet to acquire)



## Deliverables
- **Code** for event log anonymization.
- **Utility measurement** to assess data retention quality.
